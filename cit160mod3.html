 <h1><b>Music Friends</b></h1>   
 <p>My business idea would be an app that would connect people with similar 
     taste and music and use their location to bring them together.
 </p>
 <p>Primarily it would be used for finding others near you that would 
     bring people together but it has other applications. It can be used
     to show bands where they are appreciated and liked in certain areas
     to help them with their tour locations. 
 </p>   
 <p>Another application is to have events created by users to invite 
     other users to join social events. It can include local musician 
     performances or jam sessions between friends. 
 </p>
 <p>The application can be linked to Spotify or Pandora to better find 
    the music taste from the user, or have it be put in manually.

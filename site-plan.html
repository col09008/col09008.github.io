    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our purpose is for those attending a session at the temple to be able to relax and not have to worry about the worldy things. 
      They will be able to use this website to see our services such as breakfast, childcare, laundering, and much more. They will be
       able to relax and focus on having a holy experience at the house of the Lord. The website will be for customers to find information
        and contact the company to use the services.
    </p>
    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The audience will be Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and their family members that are not able to attend, 
      such as children and any elderly individuals in the temple goers care.
